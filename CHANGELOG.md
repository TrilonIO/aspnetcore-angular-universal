# Changelog

> This is a manual changelog at the moment to track the Major changes in the Repo.

## How do I stay up to date when Updates happen in this Starter?

Typically when you want to update your App with the latest from this repo, you should be able to get the latest from here
 and (depending on what has changed), you should be able to just drop in your Client & Server folders on top.

My goal is to point out the more **"Major"** issues & changes below, that might have affected the application in Client/Server aspects. 
For example, some additions made to each platform to add a new Feature (such as Storage that's using dependeny injection). 
Of course if some feature like that isn't important to you, there's no need to copy it over! A lot examples here are to get you up & 
running with a lot of the eco-system of .NET Core & Angular (v2+).

Don't hesitate to create an Issue with anything you run into, and Pull-Requests are always welcome for basic implementations of new features & fixes 
you think others would benefit from as well!

### 1.0.0-beta.6 - 2/1/2017

> Breaking changes to build system
- Webpack build system has changed to a separate client/server system. 
  - Changes to `bootstrap-server.ts`

### 1.0.0-beta.5 - 1/29/2017
- Feature: Updated to latest Angular 2.4.5
  - This allows us to upgrade Ng2-bootstrap to the latest 1.3.1 version as well (which requires importing the module differently `from 'ng2-bootstrap';` now), 
  as well as adding `.forRoot()` when importing it to our own app.common.module.
- `__2.1.1.workaround.ts` import brought to very **TOP** of `bootstrap-client` & `bootstrap-server` to avoid reflect-metadata issue.
