            timeouts, intervals, references to window/document/navigator, etc...

            We want to use platform detecting logic from Universal such as <strong>isBrowser | isNode</strong> to wrap<br>

            In a situation like this we used "isBrowser" from Universal to wrap our logic per platform.
